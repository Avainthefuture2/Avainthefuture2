- 👋 Hi, I’m Ava
- 👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity and technology in general.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that relates to either web development or cybersecurity.
- 📫 How to reach me: Discord: @avainthefuture. Instagram: @Avainthefuture, or anything else that works since I have most social media.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I play video games like The Walking Dead, Cyberpunk 2077, and other related games. I also like to play with my two dogs, Augustus and Leila and do bowling.
